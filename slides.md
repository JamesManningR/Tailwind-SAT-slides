# What is tailwind

Tailwind is a utility first css framework which generates simple atomic classes, so you can style apps quickly without sacrificing _much_ customizability

# Looking at this makes me feel ill

<img src="/img/InsaneTailwind.png" class="w-256 mb-4" />

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <div v-click class="text-left flex flex-col items-end">
    <p class="w-128 me-2">
      If you can suppress the urge to retch long enough to give it a chance, I really think youâ€™ll wonder how you ever worked with CSS any other way.

# Common issues with tailwind

That is an extreme example, but lets look at some issues with tailwind

- Classlist gets long and hard to read
- Hard to reuse code

# Keem's experience

<br/>

## Things I Loved

1. James is Tailwind God and he bestowed his blessing upon us
2. SPEED - instant gratification
3. UTILITY - Padding, hover states, custom components

<br/>

## Things To Consider

1. How much is too much?
2. Still need css modules in speific cases - Layouts
