# What is tailwind

Tailwind is a utility first css framework which generates simple atomic classes, so you can style apps quickly without sacrificing _much_ customizability

<img v-click src="/img/LibrariesSummarised.png" class="w-128" />

# What is tailwind

With tailwind, insead of using semantic class names to style your markup,

you use atomic class names which represent properties.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2">
  <div>
    <p>So insead of this</p>
    <img v-click class="h-80" src="/img/Non-TailwindCard.png" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>You do this</p>
    <img v-click src="/img/TailwindCard.png" />
  </div>
</div>

# Looking at this makes me feel ill

<img src="/img/InsaneTailwind.png" class="w-256 mb-4" />

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <div v-click class="text-left flex flex-col items-end">
    <p class="w-128 me-2 italic">
      If you can suppress the urge to retch long enough to give it a chance, I really think youâ€™ll wonder how you ever worked with CSS any other way.

# Common issues with tailwind

That is an extreme example, but lets look at some issues with tailwind

## Issues

- Classlist gets long and hard to read
- Hard to reuse code
- Delivering too much CSS when app gets large

<v-click>

## Solutions

- Use the `prettier` tailwind plugin, and use the `inline-fold` vscode extension
- Build reusable react `primitive` components
- JIT Mode (Render only the CSS you need, only when you need it)

</v-click>

# Keem's experience

<br/>

## Things I Loved

1. James is Tailwind God and he bestowed his blessing upon us
2. SPEED - instant gratification
3. UTILITY - Padding, hover states, custom components

<br/>

## Things To Consider

1. How much is too much?
2. Still need css modules in specific cases - Grid Area/Layouts
